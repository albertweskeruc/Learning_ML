# Learning_ML
This contains all the programs I programmed to learn and delve into ML with various python libraries for ML in Google Colab

ML1 I start to utilize and familize myself with numpy and tensorflow library in python provided by Google Colab to create a KNN machine learning model without using the Sklearn 
or Keras library. 

ML2 is when expanded to utilize and familize myself with sklearn library in python provided by Google Colab. I implemented various Machine Learning models that can be
created from the Sklearn library in order to find and obtain the highest accuracy for predicting potable water based on the table of rows and columns given. 

ML3 is when I finally utilize and familize myself with keras library in python provided by Google Colab. I compared both the machine learning models in Sklearn 
and Keras library to determine which models would produce the highest accuracy for prediction images.
